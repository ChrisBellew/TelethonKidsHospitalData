# TelethonKidsHospitalData

Medical researchers want a tool to help them analyse the large number of hospital admissions for children in WA. Technical tools require programming or database skills and so require the time of trained statisticians. Telethon kids institute need a tool to help them discover patterns in the diagnoses of children.

We started the weekend with the idea to build a web application to allow users to search for trends in particular diagnoses. The target audience is familier with the use of IDC-10 codes http://www.icd10data.com/ICD10CM/Codes, which classify the various diseases, so the tool allows the users to type in a range of codes and search to see the trend.

The user can click on the diagnoses in a given year and see the associated diagnoses that were made for the patients in the first chart. For instance, a trend may be shown for the diagnoses of Asthma over the 10 years, and then the user can click on a year and see that the accompanying diagnoses of respiratory infection and scoliosis were common.

A further achievement was the data mining work that revealed interesting patterns in the data. For instance, it showed that total admissions were steadily rising over the period (perhaps due to population growth). Also, we observed a change in the frequency of types of general anaesthesia. There were different types used in the first half of the period to the second half.

We found the weekend enjoyable though very challenging. We spend some time working with a medical student in Melbourne on Friday and Saturday which highlighted the problems with distance communication. In the end we found the system the medial student was proposing was not an exact fit for our needs, and we decided to write the filtering and aggregation code from scratch.

In general we were pleased, impressed and very well fed, so many thanks to the organisers and to Matt Cooper for setting us the challenge!
